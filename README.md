# topofileformats

This package has been renamed to [`AFMReader`](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/AFMReader/).

If you install this package it will pull in `AFMReader` as a dependency but you should really just install it directly
with...

``` bash
pip install AFMReader
```

Please update your package dependencies (e.g. `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`requirements.txt`) to use `AFMReader`.

Any questions please create an [issue](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/topofileformats/issues) or contact
[`topostats@sheffield.ac.uk`](mailto:topostats@sheffield.ac.uk).
